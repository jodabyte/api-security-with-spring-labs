# [API1:2023](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0xa1-broken-object-level-authorization/) Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)

Object level authorization is an access control mechanism that is usually implemented at the code level to validate that a user can only access the objects that they should have permissions to access. 

- Check the ownership of the object
- Use RBAC to restrict access
